# Welcome to MY readme ! 
Hello, my name is [Name]. I am developing my skills in software development with a focus on SQL, C#, JavaScript, React, and ASP.NET Core. My background so far includes academic study, self-directed learning, and personal projects that allow me to explore both backend and frontend development.

With C#, I practice object-oriented programming and backend logic, building small systems that demonstrate how code can be structured for clarity and maintainability.

On the frontend, I use JavaScript to add interactivity and React to organize applications into components, manage state, and create user interfaces that are both dynamic and reusable. ASP.NET Core complements these efforts on the backend, giving me a framework for creating APIs and connecting frontend applications with server-side logic.

Through my personal projects, I have been able to apply these skills in practical contexts. Each project helps me reinforce key concepts, experiment with new techniques, and gain a deeper understanding of how different technologies work together.

I am motivated to keep improving, to broaden my knowledge, and to continue practicing software development in ways that prepare me for larger and more complex projects in the future.
